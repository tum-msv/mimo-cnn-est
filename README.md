## Abstract
A convolutional neural network estimator which
learns the minimum mean squared error channel estimator for
single-antenna users was recently proposed. We generalize the
architecture to the estimation of MIMO channels with multiple antenna
users and incorporate assumptions, such as a high number
of antennas and a single propagation cluster, which reduces
the computational complexity tremendously. Learning is used in
this context to combat the mismatch between the assumptions
and real scenarios with a limited number of antennas and many
propagation clusters. We derive a high-level description of the
estimator for arbitrary choices of the pilot sequence. It turns
out that the proposed estimator has the implicit structure of
a two-layered convolutional neural network, where the derived
quantities can be relaxed to learnable parameters. We show that
by using discrete Fourier transform based pilots the number of
network parameters decreases significantly and the online run
time of the estimator is reduced considerably, where we can
achieve linearithmic order of complexity in the number of antennas.
Numerical results display performance gains compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms from the field of compressive sensing
or covariance estimation of the same or higher computational
complexity. The simulation code is available online.
